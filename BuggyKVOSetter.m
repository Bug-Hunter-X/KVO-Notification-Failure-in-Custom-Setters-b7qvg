In Objective-C, a subtle error can occur when using KVO (Key-Value Observing) with custom setters. If a custom setter doesn't call [self willChangeValueForKey:] before modifying the observed property and [self didChangeValueForKey:] afterward, KVO notifications won't be triggered correctly, leading to unexpected behavior in observers. This often manifests as UI elements not updating or other dependent logic failing to execute.
